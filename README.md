# Shrimpy Personal Portfolio API Client 

This API Client is for the management and automation of your personal Shrimpy account. If you are developing an application and would like to integrate trading capabilities, please refer to the [Shrimpy Developer API](https://developers.shrimpy.io/).

This simple API Client is based on the Official API Client provided by Shrimpy. The documention for using the personal portfolio API is ambiguous. Using this client can save you time and make your code cleaner.

The shrimpy.py file that is included is just a sample script to get you started.

Please review the [Shrimpy Portfolio Documentation](https://www.shrimpy.io/docs/#introduction) for additional information about endpoints and data types.
